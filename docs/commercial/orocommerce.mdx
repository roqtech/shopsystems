                ### Bird‚Äôs eye view

                When building a project with Scayle, the typical steps may include:

                * Manual configuration of your shop in the Panel
                * Development of your Custom Storefront based either on their templates or from-scratch (see below). The checkout is provided as a SaaS application, which is embedded into the custom storefront.
                * Integration with other systems via self-developed Custom Middleware
                * Projects typically operate their custom storefront and middleware by themselves.

                ### Storefront approach

                Scayle is a headless SaaS platform, requiring you to build and operate your own storefront.

                They provide a Nuxt.js-based template ([Storefront Boilerplate](https://scayle.dev/en/storefront-guide/developer-guide/getting-started/about-storefront)), but the checkout is rendered by Scayle and can only be configured.

                ### Panel (Admin UI)

                Scayle is managed via its admin UI called Panel. All of its functionality is also accessible through the Admin API.

                The panel can be extended by implementing add-ons [üåê](https://scayle.dev/en/add-on-guide/getting-started/reference-architecture#scayle-panel-configuration) and using the micro-architecture approach.

                Licence costs are always negotiated individually with each customer. For a general idea, you can refer to About You's earnings call presentation [üåê](https://ir.aboutyou.de/download/companies/58027/Presentations/24-5-7_ABOUT_YOU_FY_23_24_Earnings_Call_Presentation.pdf), which indicates an average recurring revenue (ARR) of ‚Ç¨1.8M per customer.
