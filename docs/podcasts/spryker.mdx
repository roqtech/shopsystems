Podcast Summary
===============

In this episode of the *ROQ Tech Shop Systems Podcast*, Fabian Wesner and Tim Niemeier from ROQ Technology interview [Elena Leonova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elenaleonova/), CPO at [Spryker](/commercial/spryker), a modular commerce platform designed for complex B2B and marketplace models. The conversation dives into Spryker’s vision, technological foundation, and how it enables enterprises to handle sophisticated digital commerce needs.

### History and Positioning

Elena introduces Spryker as a platform built specifically for **enterprise customers with complex and multi-layered business models**. Unlike traditional e-commerce solutions, Spryker caters to industries such as **automotive, industrial goods, and manufacturing**, where businesses need **highly flexible, scalable, and future-proof commerce solutions**.

Spryker is not a one-size-fits-all platform but is instead **modular and API-first**, allowing enterprises to adapt it to their specific needs. Companies with **unique workflows, B2B2C models, or marketplace setups** benefit the most from Spryker, as it provides a foundation that **supports complex interactions between manufacturers, distributors, and resellers**.

### Architectural Philosophy and Technology Stack

Spryker is built around a **modular monolith** approach, giving enterprises the **flexibility of microservices without the complexity of managing them individually**. The **open-code** philosophy allows customers to **view and modify the core system**, making it adaptable to custom business requirements.

Key architectural principles include:  
- **API-first design** for seamless integrations with external systems.  
- **PHP-based codebase** for wide developer accessibility.  
- **Composable commerce** approach, allowing businesses to select and integrate best-in-class third-party solutions.  
- **Multi-layered business models** support, catering to businesses operating across multiple distribution channels.

Spryker is a **cloud-based solution**, with many customers choosing **AWS for hosting**, though it remains cloud-agnostic. It offers both **B2B and marketplace-ready solutions**, ensuring enterprises have the right tools to manage large-scale e-commerce operations.

### Business Model and Monetization

Unlike open-source platforms, Spryker follows an **open-code model**—while customers **don’t need a license to access the code**, they do require one to use it in production. This approach combines transparency with enterprise-grade support, offering:  
- **Customizable solutions** without the maintenance risks of open-source software.  
- **Dedicated customer success teams** guiding enterprises through complex projects.  
- **Value engineering services** to optimize commerce strategies.

Spryker differentiates itself from traditional SaaS platforms by allowing enterprises to **deeply customize their commerce operations** while still benefiting from **regular product updates and enterprise-level support**.

### Community and Ecosystem

Spryker maintains a **strong partner ecosystem** consisting of:  
- **Solution integrators** who implement Spryker for customers.  
- **Technology partners** (e.g., Algolia for search, Stripe for payments) that provide deep integrations.  
- **A developer community** that contributes new capabilities and participates in hackathons and knowledge-sharing events.

The **Spryker Commerce Quest community** serves as a hub for **developers, partners, and customers** to collaborate. Spryker also runs **regular user groups, roadmap sessions, and developer enablement programs**, ensuring that the ecosystem continues to evolve.

### Challenges and Future Vision

Elena shares that Spryker’s **future focus** includes:  
- **Enhancing AI-powered developer tools** to improve efficiency.  
- **Expanding support for hybrid B2B commerce models** that merge self-service with sales-driven processes.  
- **Strengthening its composable commerce ecosystem** by integrating more best-in-class solutions.  
- **Improving the developer experience** with SDKs and AI-assisted integrations.

Spryker aims to remain the go-to platform for enterprises with **highly complex digital commerce needs**, ensuring they have the tools to scale, innovate, and future-proof their business models.
